# 🎓 Volcano Plot with Gene Labeling using Python

Welcome to my Fundamentals of Data Science in Precision Medicine and Cloud Computing Data blog, hosted on GitHub!

This repository contains a detailed walkthrough of how I used Python and the `bioinfokit` library to generate a **volcano plot** with **custom gene labels**, as part of my training with the **Stanford Data Ocean Precision Medicine Program**.
